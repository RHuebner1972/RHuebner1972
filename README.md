# Tech Stack
- I use my Python, R, and SQL skills for coding data science, machine learning, and AI solutions. Frameworks range from pytorch, pands, keras/tensorflow, langchain, and more.
- I develop SQL in databases like: redshift, snowflake, mongodb, mysql, postgres
- For data visualizations, I use PowerBI, Tableau, and R/Python stuff like ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, etc.
- I am particularly passionate about the insights gained from unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering, association rules, and dimensionality reduction with PCA.
- If you're up for talking about HC-PCA (and know what that referrs to) then I'm in! I love dendrograms! I used this technique recently for building new marketing personas.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- A Web scraper for DEI-related search 📖
- Prompt engineering for an AI Tutor
- Clustering and association rule (aka frequent itemset mining) for product-related insights
- Developing a way to manage prompts via a database
- Researching using LLMs to chat with CSV files and database tables from Snowflake 📊
- Exploring propensity models
